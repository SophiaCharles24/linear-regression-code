The model draws on data from an Excel file (converted to CSV) with columns for year, event occurrence (“yes” or “uncertain”), and annual data for each tree-ring record. 

//Read the CSV file into the console 
file <- read.csv(“file.csv")

//Indicate independent (y) variable 
file$y = as.factor(file$y)

//Plot and generate a visual representation of independent variable occurrence over time
ggplot(file, aes(YearAD, fill = y)) +
       geom_bar() +
       coord_flip()

//Designate eighty percent of the data to train model and set aside twenty percent of the data to test the model
set.seed(421)
split <- initial_split(file, prop = 0.8, strata = y)
train <- split %>% 
          training()
test <- split %>% 
     testing()

//Program the model:
model <- logistic_reg(mixture = double(1), penalty = double(1)) %>%
   set_engine("glm") %>%
   set_mode("classification") %>%
   fit(y ~ ., data = train)

//Generate a table of correlation factors where “estimate” indicates correlation factors, with three error indices (“std.error,” “statistic,” and “p.value”) for each
tidy(model)


//Evaluate model accuracy
pred_class <- predict(model,
                      new_data = test,
                       type = "class")
pred_proba <- predict(model,
                      new_data = test,
                       type = "prob")

            select(y) %>%
